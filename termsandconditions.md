# Terms and Conditions for Developers 📜

## Payments 💰

Developers will only be paid if they adhere to the guidelines(Please also see our [Rules for Submission](https://github.com/Techligence/LogicBlocks/blob/main/guidelines.md) for more details) and also the one mentioned in the given tasks. The completed work, as mentioned in the given task, should also compile without any errors and bugs and should be consistent with the main branch.

🚫 Avoiding Conflicts: Conflicts arise when changes overlap. It's essential to ensure that, when your branch is merged into the main branch, there aren't any conflicting changes that would prevent the merge.

🔄 Staying Updated: Regularly update (or "pull") the latest changes from the main branch into your working branches. This ensures you're always building upon the most recent version of the code.

✅ Adhering to Standards: Ensure that changes align with established coding standards and practices. This consistency aids in making the codebase remain clean, understandable, and maintainable.



## Basic Workflow 🌊

### Claiming Tasks 🎯

1. **Task Release**: All tasks will be released with accompanying descriptions and requirements.
2. **Google Form Submission**: If you are interested in taking up a task, you must fill out the Registration Form (sent to your email) provided for claiming tasks.
3. **First Come, First Serve**: Tasks will be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis. The first developer to fill out the form will be alloted the task.
4. **Local rules to each task also apply** : Don't forget to read the instructions that come with each task as they also apply towards payment criterion.

### Deadlines ⏰

1. **Three-Day Window**: After you have been assigned a task, you have 3 days to complete it and submit it for review.
2. **Expiration**: If you do not complete the task within the 3-day window, the task will be reopened for others to complete first and claim the money.

### Contact and Withdrawal 🏳️

1. **Contact Form**: If you encounter issues or have questions while working on a task, you may fill out this separate Contact Form (sent to your email) to get in touch for assistance.
2. **Withdrawal**: You may withdraw from a task if you find you are unable to complete it. The task will then be reopened for other developers to claim. You can use the same Contact Form to initiate the withdrawal process.
