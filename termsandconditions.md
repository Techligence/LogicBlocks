# Terms and Conditions for Developers 📜

## Payments 💰

Developers will only be paid if they adhere to the guidelines and compile without any errors and bugs and is consistent with the main branch.

🚫 Avoiding Conflicts: Conflicts arise when changes overlap. It's essential to ensure that, when your branch is merged into the main branch, there aren't any conflicting changes that would prevent the merge.

🔄 Staying Updated: Regularly update (or "pull") the latest changes from the main branch into your working branches. This ensures you're always building upon the most recent version of the code.

✅ Adhering to Standards: Ensure that changes align with established coding standards and practices. This consistency aids in making the codebase remain clean, understandable, and maintainable.
